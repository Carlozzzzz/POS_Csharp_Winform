## 🏗️ 3. Scalability & Architecture
The app will follow a **layered architecture** for easy maintenance and scalability:

- **UI Layer:** Windows Forms for display  
- **Business Logic Layer (BLL):** Handles application rules and processing  
- **Data Access Layer (DAL):** Handles database operations and Excel integration  

**Best Practices:**
- Each feature will be in its own class/module to avoid code dependencies
- Use SQL Server or SQLite for main data storage
- Excel is used for importing/exporting, not as the primary database

---

## 📡 4. Barcode Scanner & Excel Integration
- **Barcode Scanner:** Works as a keyboard input; the scanned code is entered into a TextBox and processed when `Enter` is detected.
- **Excel Integration:**  
  - Use **ClosedXML** or **EPPlus** library for reading and writing Excel files
  - Allow importing product lists from Excel
  - Allow exporting sales reports to Excel
